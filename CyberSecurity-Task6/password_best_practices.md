# üîí Password Security Best Practices

## ‚úÖ What Makes a Password Strong?
1. **Length Matters Most**: Passwords with 12+ characters are much stronger
2. **Character Variety**: Use mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
3. **Avoid Common Patterns**: Don't use "123", "password", "qwerty"
4. **No Personal Info**: Avoid names, birthdays, pet names
5. **Unpredictability**: Don't use dictionary words or common phrases

## üö® Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Trying every possible combination
- **Dictionary Attack**: Using common words and passwords
- **Phishing**: Tricking users into revealing passwords
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using leaked passwords from other sites

## üí° Key Findings from This Task
1. **Length > Complexity**: A longer password (`I-L0v3-Cyber-S3cur1ty!`) is stronger than a short complex one (`H3ll0!`)
2. **Password Meters Vary**: Different tools give different scores for the same password
3. **Time to Crack Matters**: Some "strong" passwords can be cracked in hours, others in millions of years

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Practices
- Use **passphrases** instead of passwords (e.g., `Purple-Turtle-Jumps-Over-42-Mountains!`)
- Enable **multi-factor authentication** whenever possible
- Use a **password manager** to generate and store strong, unique passwords
- Never reuse passwords across different accounts
- Change passwords immediately after a data breach

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using the same password everywhere
- Writing passwords on sticky notes
- Sharing passwords via email or text
- Using easily guessable security questions
- Not updating default passwords on devices
